A very pretty and convenient theme that can replace your panel directly.
It's particularily adapted for netbooks or laptops.

The bottom dock contains launchers, minimized windows, and files access.
The left-side dock contains some useful accessories.

Special Thanks to <b>Martino Ferrari</b> for the <i>Square Dock</i> icons.
